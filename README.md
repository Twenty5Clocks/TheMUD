# TheMUD
A MUD that will rule them all

I am hoping for this MUD to be very similar to EVE the online MMORPG that rules them all.

Steps to complete as I see them
--------------------------------
**Be able to use header files and multiple files in a C++ program
**Build the touppercase and to lowercase programs
build the parsing of words.
start building the world
think about the structure of the entire game(classes and such)
build the server and start by refering to the loopback address(127.0.0.1)
make sure we are using the server to parse the correct info
solidify the stats/world/travelling... MUD stuff
come up with a name
